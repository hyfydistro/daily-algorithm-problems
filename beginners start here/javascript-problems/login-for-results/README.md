# Login for Results

\#Conditionals

## Brief

Create an `if...else` structure that checks whether the machine is switched on and puts a message into the `machineResult` variable telling the user whether it is on or off.

If the machine is on, we want to a second conditional to run that checks whether the `pwd` is equal to `cheese`. If so, it should assign a string to `pwdResult` telling the user they logged in successfully. If not, it should assign a different string to `pwdResult` telling the user their login attempt was not successful. Do this in a single line, using something that isn't an `if...else` structure.

## Keynotes

* `machineActive` - contains an indicator of whether the login machine is switched on or not (`true` / `false`).

* `pwd` - Contains the user's login password.

* `machineResult` - begins uninitialized, but is later used to store a response that will be printed to the outpanel, letting the user know whether the machine is switched on.

* `pwdResult` - begins uninitialized, but is later used to store a response that will be printed to the output panel, letting the user know whether their login attempt was successful.
