# A Simple Character Animation

The image contains six sprites that make up the whole walking sequence. Each one is 102 pixels wide and 148 pixels high. To display each sprite clearly we will have to use drawImage() to shop out a singel sprite image from the spritesheet and display only that part.

The X coordinate of the slice will have to be multiple of 102, and the Y coordinate will alway sbe 0. The slice size will always be 102 by 148 pixels.

Image dimension: 612w x 148h.
