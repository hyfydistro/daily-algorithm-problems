# Phone Book Search

\#for-loops "hashtag"

# Brief

We want to search through an array of contacts and telephone numbers and return just the number we wanted to find.

# Keynotes

First, some simple HTML - a text `<input>` allowing us to enter a name to search for, a `<button>` element to submit a search, and a `<p>` element to display the results.

* `String.prototype.split()`

The `split()` method turns a `String` into an array of strings, by separating the string at each instance of a specified separator string.

**Syntax:**

_str_.split([separator[, _limit_]])
