# Top Five Searches

# Brief:

Here we’re giving you a fake search sight with a search box. The idea it that when terms are entered in the search box, the top 5 previous search terms are displayed in the list. When the number of terms goes over 5, the last term starts being deleted each time a new term is added to the top, so the 5 previous terms are always displayed.

NB: In the real search app, you’d probably be able to click the previous search terms to return to previous searches, and it would display actual search results!

To complete this app, we need you to:

1. Add a line that adds the current value entered into the search input to the start of the array. This can be retrieved using `searchInput.value`.

2. Add a line that removes the value currently at the end of the array.
