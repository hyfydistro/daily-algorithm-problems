# Shopping List

A simple shopping list that allows you to dynamically add items to the list using a form input and button. When you add an item to the input and press the button:

* The item should appear in the list.
* Each items should be given a button that can be pressed to delete that item off the list.
* The input should be emptied and focused ready for you to enter another item.
