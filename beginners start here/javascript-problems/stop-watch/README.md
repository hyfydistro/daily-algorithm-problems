# Stop Watch

## Brief

Modify it and create your own simple stopwatch.

You need to display a time, but in this you need:

* A "Start" button to start the stopwatch running.

* A "Stop" button to pause / stop it.

* A "Reset" button to reset the time back to `0`.

* The time display to show the number of seconds elapsed, rather than the actual time.
