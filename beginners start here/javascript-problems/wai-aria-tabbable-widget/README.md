# Tabbable Widget

A info box with its own tabs. When a tab is selected that info box is revealed. This applies to the rest of the tabs and its own tabs (they all have their own content when _selected_ or tabbed on).

## Developer's Notes

I don't understand why it won't read the content when the tab is selected (user press `enter`).

Call this "unfinish". _shrug_
