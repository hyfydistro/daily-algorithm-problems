# Checking for Prime numbers

\#loop

## Brief

You are provided the following:

* `i` - starts off with a value of 500. It is intended to be used as an iterator.

* `para` - contains a reference to a paragraph, which will be used to report the results.

* `isPrime()` - a function that, when passed a number, returns `true` if the number is a prime number, and `false` if not.

You need to use a loop to go through the numbers 1 to 500 backwards, and run the provided `isPrime()` function on them. For each number that isn't a prime number, continue on to the next loop iteration. For each one that is a prime number, add it to the paragraph's `textContent` along with some kind of separator.

## Keynotes

* What is a "Prime Number"?

A Prime Number can only be divisible by 1 or itself.

e.g.

1, 2, 3, and 5.
