What is a factorial?

A factorial is a function that multiplies a number by every number below it.

e.g. `5`

        5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120

The function is used, among other things, to find the number of way "n" objects can be arranged.

Factorial: There are n! ways of arranging n distinct objects into an ordered sequence.

n: the set or population.

* `onchange` event handler runs whenever the `change` event fires on the text input = that is, when a new value is entered into the text `input`, and submitted (e.g. enter a value, then press tab). When this anonymous function runs, the value in the `input` is stored in the `num` constant.

* In the conditional test, the test looks at whether the expression `isNaN()` returns `true`. The `isNaN()` function test whether the `num` value is not a number. If so, it returns a `true`, and if not, it returns `false`.
